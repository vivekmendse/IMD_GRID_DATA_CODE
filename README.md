# IMD_GRID_DATA_CODE

This is my CPP code which read Gridded data Binary File provided by IMD ( indian meteorological department )
The binary file is available for download at : 

https://imdpune.gov.in/Clim_Pred_LRF_New/Grided_Data_Download.html

The above website also has sample code to read binary files.

the original output generated by IMD code is very difficult to read so Here I have provided CPP code
to create CSV file which you can import in MSSQL and then you can filter data as per your requirement.

my code also use boost cpp library

you are free to use my code.
